doom-start-scripts
==================

Just a set of scripts I use to start [Zandronum][zandronum] and [ZDoom][zdoom]
with various WADs in varoius modes (client, server, standalone).

Always remember to check the scripts and their parameters before running them.

Usage
-----

Rename `config.example.ps1` into `config.ps1` and change the parameters. After
that, run the scripts.
